## 1. Employee Statistics Program
**Description:**  
This C# console application demonstrates how to work with collections, LINQ queries, and basic data processing. It includes methods to calculate the average age of employees, count the number of employees, and find the oldest employee for each company. This project highlights my understanding of LINQ for querying data, handling collections, and working with classes and objects in C#.

## 2. Notes Store Management Program
**Description:**  
This C# application simulates a notes management system, where notes can be added and retrieved based on their state (e.g., active, completed, others). The program utilizes enums to define valid states and includes error handling to manage invalid inputs. This project showcases my ability to design object-oriented solutions, handle exceptions, and use enums and collections effectively in C#.
